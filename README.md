## Description
1.

version A)
He lived on a freezing mid sized island of Ajka ruled by a corrupt official allowing a mafia of sorts to take control.

The ruthless mafia leader had them take a cocktail of drugs to increase their productivity in the factories, mines and greenhouses. During his baptism in the drug lab when the children were given the first large dose to have their body get used to it an accident caused him to be exposed to before untested levels of the drugs. Normal dosages allow the bearer a decent resistance to pain, disease, exhaustion and cold and increased reflexes. All this with the minor side-effect of making one's mind sluggish, worsening memory and lowering the life expectancy by half (considered a very good tradeoff by the mafiosos). In the dosage he was exposed to it, well let's just say it took the scientists a few minutes to free their minds of images of the ancient's legends of zombies.

Only recently (in his teens) the whole thing was revealed to the wider world. The governer and mafiosos were arrest and most people emigrated from the island.

version B)
His ancestors were prisoners at a high security facility on an isolated island near the equator. After a bloody and shocking prison riot the authorities decided to almost unilaterally assign a death sentance to all the islands convicts, most of whom had been there as a life sentance anyway. No real effort had to be taken to stop them from escaping as all that was needed was a little sattelite surveilance and they could be sure the hostile fauna that was purposefully not exterminated (partially for the sake of preservation and partially for sake of ) would take care of them easily.

Being cut off from the mainland and being forced to live in a harsh tropic environment the people of AIka had to take drastic measures to ensure their survival. Having among them two great physicians (their practices generally considered criminally insane) they developed a coctail of drugs to help them endure the heat and survive against the deadly diseases and fauna of their world. Snup was one of such people, but during his baptism in the drug lab an accident caused him to be exposed to before untested levels of the drugs. Normal dosages allow the bearer a decent resistance to pain, disease and heat and increased reflexes. All this with the minor side-effect of being highly addictive, making one's mind sluggish, worsening memory and lowering the life expectancy by two thirds (considered a very good tradeoff by the Ajkans). In the dosage he was exposed to it, well let's just say it took the scientists a few minutes to free their minds of images of the ancient's legends of zombies.

Only recently (in his teens) his people have finally been freed of the crimes of their ancestors and let back into society.

2.
His community now basically looks like poor immigrant russian communities in 70s America.

No one really ever figured out how come he didn't die within a few days of being exposed to the drug. He himself believes it to be the God or fate giving him a leg up so he could help his family and people.

He and his small community worked as muscle in less than reputable places for years (being uneducated and not used to normal society) before he was able to afford enough to lead an almost decent life. This has led to him getting a bunch of experience with weapons. His people developed a combat stile using modern weaponry that made their disadvantages be less noticable: Gunfu. Most of his people still go from door to door looking for odd jobs as their strange tatoos and chemical dependency keep them outside the society. The tatooes he wears are now a symbol of a community of low lives.

He mostly works ‘Normaparal INC.’  as muscle because most other workplaces have no use for the likes of him. Also not being wanted in the police force this job sometimes allows him to take revenge at the mobsters that have made his people's lives so miserable. Sometimes he is able to crack a case out of the blue when he clears his mind for a while and his backgroud is of use. All this to the annoyance of his collegues.

He is often annoyed at others when their inability to crack a case leads to civilians getting hurt the same as the foolishness of the authorities caused his people to. Trusts authorities to some extent but not fully.

The work he has to do keep his parents and siblings from being evicted leaves little time for him to actually see them or get a family of his own.

He is in his early 30s. His eyes are red and the veins on his head bulge a bit. He's got brown hair, green-brown eyes and completely white skin. His face is in constant confused happy bemusement. Has a large tatoo on his hand reading in stylized letters vychod.

Being brutally efficent he has few qualms about doing morally repugnant things as long as they don't hurt anyone or he justifies them to himself.

Retains some knowledge of botany and biology as he is forced to make the drug to keep away the withdrawal symptoms (likely agonizing death). It requires a lot of focus from him though.


# Notes

## Nihillis

Nihillis is a planet that seems to be stuck in time. Historians hardly agrre on what was teh cause, but they had a growth spurt from tribes, believing in gods and magics, to very sudden industrialization, and invention of the steam machine, that could help travel the world. With naturally rich soils, and mineral mines, the world slowly started stagnating, with the precedent that everyone lives a perfect life becoming a mental state of most, going as far as governments actively stopping breakthroughs in the technological industry. Everything happened in a couple generations, and with life having almost a perfect balance for most, a need to improve disappeared for over a hundred years.

  
People live comfortabily: home appliances are something that’s taken from the 70s, with minimal differences to life styles. Internet is mostly a thing used by largest private corporations, and people mostly have a mindset of meeting in real life to enjoy the time they have.

Most popular Urban legends are about people who claim to have seen aliens, ghosts or other type of monsters and magical creatures. Although the government publically claims these instances as false rumors created by fantasizing people, You have face the reality – Your job is to deal with the instances that turn out to not be fake.

Your work in the ‘Normaparal INC.’ has its own pros and cons. Your life is much more interesting and wild than compared to a civilian’s, but You also understand that each job is a risk on Your life. You sometimes wonder what makes You choose this proffesion. The thrill of death? The ability to know something other’s don’t? Or are You trying to uncover something while partaking in this planet-wide ruse?

**----------------**

4 am. Your work pager beeps and buzzes waking You up. One of he inspectors has disappeared the evening before while investigating a potentail haunting case. A team of various specialists has been created, with the whole operation called “A team-building exorcise”, starting in the morning, and with no additional info provided. Hopefully You manage to catch some sleep before the bus.
